# AIFaceRecognition
A python script that can recognise the faces of people using AI. Currently set to recognise (Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Justin Trudeau). However; if you add the picture of anyone to the PictureFolder it will recognise them once the python program runs (RealTimeFaceRecognition.py).

NOTE*: If you add a photo to the PictureFolder, make sure that no other extraneous files are added aswell other wise the program will not work. This program works only if the PictureFolder contains .jpg files. Other files cannot be encoded by the neuronetwork and causes problems
